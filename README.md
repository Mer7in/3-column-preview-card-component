## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

wtring less css is sometimes the better way to achieve what we want. This is a general rule. There are times when you want to use height, but for the most part, they cause more issues than they solve.
